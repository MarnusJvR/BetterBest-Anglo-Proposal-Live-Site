        The management unit developed specialized project & finance management
        model for this specific project
      </h1>
      <p>
        After a detailed review of the RFQ scope of work, the Better Best
        Management Unit have developed a specialized project & finance
        management model that is aimed at the requirements and risk factors as
        it relates to this project. At the onset it is noted: - There are risk
        factors unique to this project that must be considered. - Proposed model
        is designed around the concepts of accountability, risk mitigation and
        cash-flow management. - Project is data intensive and time sensitive. -
        Specialized data management measures required. - A critical component is
        viewed to be the successful implementation of the Learner Management
        System customized to this project. - The system is designed to keep
        daily track of student attendance, training provider performance,
        project milestones, QA-requirements and project expenses. - System
        design allows for live monitoring of project progress by steer-com and
        project owners (updated daily)

      <h1>Our LMS is at the heart of the proposed implimentation model</h1>
      <p>
        In partnership with a MYCito and a team of web-developers, Better Best
        had developed a custom Management Information System specifically built
        for the implementation and monitoring of large-scale skills development
        projects. The system is designed to incorporate modern data analytics
        tools into the management platform in a way that enables data-driven
        decision making. In short, the system is built to bring the right data
        to the right people at the right time. The proposed project plan is
        designed around the use of this system, as the system allows for:<ul class="striped-list">
            <li>Daily student attendance tracking.</li>
            <li>Training provider management.</li>

            <li>Training progress tracking.</li>
            <li>Quality Assurance Reporting.</li>
            <li>Active live dashboard allowing project

        <h1>Project performance & training provider tracking with LMS</h1>
        <p>
            The proposed project plan will see the appointment of multiple training providers, overseeing several different training initiatives. The project plan is designed to align training activities of the different providers onto a uniform schedule, allowing for a consistent flow of students through the structure. This type of schedule does raise several risk factors, as a delay early in the implementation plan can result in a significant ripple effect. The management system greatly reduces this risk, by identifying risk factors early on and providing project owners a live view of activities. The landing page lists all active providers and shows where they are in the training process. The system immediately highlights risks as it pertains to the roll-out plan, and notifies project owners when<ul class="striped-list">
              <li>Training provider is not aligned with the training schedule.</li>
              <li>Training provider daily attendance reflective report is not uploaded.</li>

        <h1>Live dashboard & automated report generation</h1>
        <p>
            Managing the proposed project based on the Better Best / MyCito LMS system will allow for live project tracking. This provides project owners access to a live portal that provides key performance metrics and allows for quick risk identification. The system is updated daily, meaning that risk factors can be identified. The system also allows for automatic generation of PDF reports at the click of a button:
            <ul class="striped-list">
              <li>Provider Level Report: Summary report of provider performance, including student numbers, assessment progress, finance claims and invoices</li>
              <li>Student Level Report: Summary of a specific student’s progress including student assessment results and attendance.</li>
              <li>Project Level Report: Overview report summarizes all provider activities and aligning them to planned timeline. Project level report is also able to track finance performance and highlight any budget risks.</li>
