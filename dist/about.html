        <p class="lead">
          Our specialized project management methodologies have been specifically developed for the difficult and complex skills development environment we 
          have in South Africa. These methodologies have been proven through various successful projects, amounting to more than 20,000 learners trained in 
          a rural setting. The mythologies presented here carries special relevance for skills development project in the Magalakwena district, where 
          Better Best has significant experience in the implementation of these types of projects.

                    <h3>Custom Management Information System</h3>
                    <p>
                      At the heart of all activities in our proposed implementation mode is our custom build LMS. In partnership with a team of web-developers, 
                      Better Best had developed a custom Management Information System specifically built for the implementation and monitoring of large-scale 
                      skills development projects. The system is designed to incorporate modern data analytics tools into the management platform in a way that 
                      enables data-driven decision making. In short, the system is built to bring the right data to the right people at the right time. 
                      The proposed project plan is designed around the use of this system, as the system allows for:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Daily student attendance tracking.</li>
                      <li>Training provider management</li>
                      <li>Provider invoice and payment management</li>
                      <li>Training progress tracking</li>
                      <li>Active live dashboard allowing project owners to track overall project activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                        <h3>Automated Training Provider Tracking & Management</h3>
                        <p>
                          The proposed project plan will see the appointment of multiple training providers, overseeing several different training initiatives. The project plan is designed to align training activities of the different providers onto a uniform schedule, allowing for a consistent flow of students through the structure. This type of schedule does raise several risk factors, as a delay early in the implementation plan can result in a significant ripple effect. The management system greatly reduces this risk, by identifying risk factors early on and providing project owners a live view of activities. The landing page lists all active providers and shows where they are in the training process. The system immediately highlights risks as it pertains to the roll-out plan, and notifies project owners when:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Training provider is not aligned with the training schedule</li>
                          <li>Training provider daily attendance reflective report is not uploaded</li>
                          <li>High levels of student absenteeism.</li>
                          <li>Outstanding assessment reports</li>
                          <li>Assessment reports are not reflecting wanted level of performance.</li>

                            <p>
                              Managing the proposed project based on the Better Best / MyCito LMS system will allow for live project tracking. 
                              This provides project owners access to a live portal that provides key performance metrics and allows for quick risk 
                              identification. The system is updated daily, meaning that risk factors can be identified. The system also allows for
                              automatic generation of PDF reports at the click of a button:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><b>Provider Level Report:</b> Summary report of provider performance, including student numbers, assessment progress, finance claims and invoices</li>
                              <li><b>Student Level Report:</b> Summary of a specific student’s progress including student assessment results and attendance</li>
                              <li><b>Project Level Report:</b> Overview report summarizes all provider activities and aligning them to planned timeline. 
                                Project level report is also able to track finance performance and highlight any budget risks</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Appointment of Training Providers</h3>
                            <p>
                              With over 2 decades of experience as a professional training provider, the management team knows all the pitfalls and risk factors as it 
                              pertains to training providers. This activity is highlighted as a key component for the overall success of the program. The Finance Control 
                              Systems section of this proposal goes into more detail as per how the procurement and payment structure for training providers are managed. 
                              From experience, the Better Best management team highly recommends the following components in the appointment and management of training 
                              providers to be considered:  
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Skills programs in Magalakwena have historically presented with higher than normal learner dropout rates. The way to mitigate this risk factor is to make training providers responsible for learner attendance. This can be achieved by basing the training provider fee structure on a per-learner-per-day basis. This means that training providers are paid only for learners in attendance. The proposed LMS will allow the management company to track attendance and calculate payments accordingly.</li>
                              <li>Training providers must have accreditation with the relevant SETA with an expiry date later than the project close date</li>
                              <li>Training provider must have proven capabilities in SETA data base uploads</li>
                              <li>Training provider must be able to show active learning material aligned to project outcomes</li>
                              <li>Training provider must be able to show sufficient infrastructure</li>
                              <li>Training provider must be able to demonstrate sufficient cash-flow to finance operations.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div>

                              Better Best boosts with an ISO aligned quality assurance management system. This incorporates all operating policies and procedures together 
                              with our well-defined and tested payroll management system The Better Best management unit will also implement a detailed provider & learner support structure.  
                            </p>
                            <p>A vital component of the project is the operation of a comprehensive Learner support program.  The main thrust of this support function is to liaise closely with the training providers, line managers and coaches to provide a support system that enhances the chances of the individual learner’s success.  Furthermore, the learner support program provides learners with a trusted, neutral person with whom they can build a relationship during their tenure on the program.
                              Better Best employs the services of highly qualified and experienced LSOs (Learner Support Officials) to provide the learners with a structured, reliable and trusted support system.  </p>
                              <p>The LSO will be available on an ad-hoc basis to assist learners with personal matters, academic difficulties and issues in the workplace, continuously measuring all aspects of demanding learners’ progress and well-being. Apart from training progress and workplace experience, the LSO will also focus on soft issues that may affect the learner’s progress.  
                                All LSOs will submit a monthly report to the lead LSO, who issues a consolidated monthly report analyzing challenges and solutions. 
                                Disabled learners; Special attention will be paid to the reasonable accommodation of disabled learners.  The LSO will liaise closely with the providers to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is available for the disabled learners. The progress of the disabled learner in the formal training environment is managed closely together with the training provider.

                            <p>
                              M&E activities will have learning and re-planning at its core, allowing for capacity building of all resources with particular focus on 
                              system - and human resource development.  In order to make monitoring and evaluation possible, the M&E team selected for the project will 
                              work closely with relevant project stakeholders to develop an M&E Framework which clearly shows primary outcomes, operational definition of 
                              each of the desired outcomes, measurable success indicators as well as evidence/data to be collected in the M&E process.  

                              The QA process includes therefore monitoring and evaluation of all stakeholders who will participate in-, contribute to- or facilitate the 
                              learning programs.  The M&E process will focus specifically on quality assured training delivery, assessment, moderation and Learner support 
                              but will also include documentation & data control as well as adherence to approved project process & procedure.
